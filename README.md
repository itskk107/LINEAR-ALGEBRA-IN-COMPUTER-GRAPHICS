# LINEAR-ALGEBRA-IN-COMPUTER-GRAPHICS
Linear algebra plays a vital role in the field of computer graphics. This paper will give a brief introduction to linear algebra in computer graphics. Matrixes are used in computer graphics to represent numerous different types of data. 
Games with 2D or
3D visuals rely on other matrix applications to show
the game's location and characters. The linear algebra
process in computer graphics is discussed further
using examples from various areas of computer
graphics. Linear algebra is a useful weapon for
computer vision, data science, and other related fields
like computer vision and natural language processing.
Linear algebra has its own implementations in
computer vision, such as the use of matrices, vectors,
and tensors, as well as their processes such as linear
transformations, matrix operations, linear correlation,
and variable dependency
